This project falls under the GNU Public License, the terms of which are
included in the file called 'COPYING'.

This project is a modification and simplification of the mixare project for
 augmented reality. As of 5-Sept-2012 it still needs some cleanup of the
 method by which markers are added as well as a popup to display the license
 to the user. Adding a help screen is also a top priority.

As of right now, markers are added in the MixareApp.java file, but in the
future they'll be added from an xml file.

I intend to package the cleaned up code into a peak viewer file which will also
be available from my github.
